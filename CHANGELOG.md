# ColorMaster Change Log

## v0.0.7 - July 28, 2021

### Added

- HSLA and HEXA color-spaces (with tests)
- Implementation interfaces to reduce complexity of implementation scripts (less comments)
- Getter and Setter functions for arrays of object instances

- `npm dedupe` to the pre-commit hook and post-commit/pre-push hooks
- Functionality such as invert, saturate/desaturate, lightness/darkness, grayscale
- Full testing of saturation/de-saturation, lighter/darker, grayscale in all color-spaces

### Fixed

- Logic in HEXA & HSLA color-spaces that produced invalid conversions
- Logic in class methods to use getter and setter functions rather than accessing private variables

### Changed

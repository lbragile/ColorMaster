- Edge cases in `colormaster` class when generating color instances
- GitHub actions scripts

### Changed

- Getter & Setter function names to be more general
- `name()` function to search by name exactly or approximately
- `HSLAFrom()` to allow user to use CSS Name instead of number for hue channel

### Removed

## v0.0.7 - July 28, 2021

### Added

- HSLA and HEXA color-spaces (with tests)
- Implementation interfaces to reduce complexity of implementation scripts (less comments)
- Getter and Setter functions for arrays of object instances
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to create a production build
- `npm dedupe` to the pre-commit hook and post-commit/pre-push hooks
- Functionality such as invert, saturate/desaturate, lightness/darkness, grayscale
- Full testing of saturation/de-saturation, lighter/darker, grayscale in all color-spaces
- NPM scripts for releasing a publication of the module - patch, minor, major

### Fixed

- Logic in HEXA & HSLA color-spaces that produced invalid conversions
- Logic in class methods to use getter and setter functions rather than accessing private variables

### Changed

- Release script to have pre and post
- Default options from `false` to `true` as returning alpha in string is more common
- Updated README & documentation
